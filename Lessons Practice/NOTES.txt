The diffrence between \n and endl:
    
    -endl flushes the output buffer and then adds a newline character to the output stream. 
     This ensures that all output is written to the console before the program terminates.
    -\n only adds a newline character to the output stream, but does not flush the output buffer. 

literals are data values that represent a fixed value in a program. There are several types of literals in C++:
    
    - integers (whole numbers)
    - floating point numbers (numbers with decimal points)
    - characters (single characters enclosed in single quotes)
    - strings (multiple characters enclosed in double quotes)
    - boolean (true or false)
    - null (represented by the keyword null)

Escape sequences can be used to represent special characters in strings, such as newline, tab, and backslash.
    
    - \\ (backslash)
    - \t (tab)
    - \n (newline)
    - \" (double quote)
    - \' (single quote)
    - \a (audio bell)

Data types in C++:
    Fundamental types:
        Integral types:
            - int (integer)
            - char (single character)
        Floating type:
            - float (floating point number)
            - double (floating point number with double precision)
        Boolean type:
            - bool (true or false)
        String type:
            - string (multiple characters enclosed in double quotes)
        Void type:
            - void (no value)
        Wide character type:
            - wchar_t (a character type that can represent multilingual characters)
    Derived types:
            - function (a block of code that performs a specific task)
            - array (a collection of variables of the same type)
            - pointer (a variable that stores the memory address of another variable)
            - reference (a variable that refers to another variable)
    User defined:    
            - class (a user-defined type)
            - structure (a collection of related variables)
            - union (a collection of variables of different types)
            - enum (a user-defined type that consists of a set of named values)
            - typedef (a shorthand name for a data type)
