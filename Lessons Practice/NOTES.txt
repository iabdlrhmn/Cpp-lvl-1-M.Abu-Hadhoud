literals are data values that represent a fixed value in a program. There are several types of literals in C++:
    
    - integers (whole numbers)
    - floating point numbers (numbers with decimal points)
    - characters (single characters enclosed in single quotes)
    - strings (multiple characters enclosed in double quotes)
    - boolean (true or false)
    - null (represented by the keyword null)

Escape sequences can be used to represent special characters in strings, such as newline, tab, and backslash.
    
    - \\ (backslash)
    - \t (tab)
    - \n (newline)
    - \" (double quote)
    - \' (single quote)
    - \a (audio bell)
